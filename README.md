## Introduction

GitHub is a powerful platform that enables students to collaborate, share, and manage code effectively. Whether you’re working on a group project or maintaining individual work, learning how to use GitHub can enhance your ability to track changes, collaborate with team members, and improve version control. Understanding the basics of GitHub is a crucial skill for any college student working on coding projects, as it simplifies collaboration and helps prevent confusion about which version of a project is the most current.

## My Goals with GitHub

- *Learn Version Control*: I want to master using GitHub for tracking changes in code, which will help me avoid losing important work and make it easier to revert back to previous versions.
- *Improve Collaboration Skills*: GitHub provides a space for team collaboration. I aim to become proficient in using it to work efficiently with my classmates on group assignments and projects.
- *Master Git Commands*: I hope to get comfortable with basic Git commands such as commit, push, and pull, and understand how they relate to my project files.
  
## Steps I’ll Take to Get Comfortable with GitHub

1. *Familiarize Myself with Git Basics*: I’ll start by reading beginner-friendly guides and tutorials to understand the core concepts of version control, such as commits, branches, and merges.
2. *Create a Personal GitHub Repository*: I’ll set up my own repository to practice uploading files, committing changes, and learning how to organize my work on GitHub.
3. *Use GitHub for Class Projects*: I’ll apply GitHub in my college projects by creating repositories for group work and sharing my code with classmates, allowing everyone to access and contribute easily.
